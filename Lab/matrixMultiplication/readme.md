# Matrix Multiplication Project

## Complexity:
- **Medium**
- **Time Estimate:** 3 - 4 hours

## Project Objectives:
- Understanding of programming concepts such as variables, loops, and conditional statements.
- Proficiency in creating and manipulating 2-dimensional arrays.
- Ability to control user input and casting of data from one type to another.
- Understanding of string formatting techniques to display results in a readable and organized format.
- Ability to analyze problem requirements and develop algorithms to solve mathematical problems.

## Description:
This project requires the development of a program that performs matrix multiplication. The program will take two matrices as input from the user and compute their product. The product will be stored in a third matrix, which will then be displayed.

Matrix multiplication is performed when multiplying a matrix **A** of dimensions (n, m) with matrix **B** of dimensions (m, p). The result is a matrix **C** of dimensions (n, p). The multiplication is performed by multiplying the components of the two matrices row by column.

```bash


```

### Example:

Matrix A (2x3):

```bash
